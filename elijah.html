<!-- I'm going to leave this comment here and not spread out in the code because this is really simple HTML, but I basically just added every required 
    tag from the assignment and tried to make them at least somewhat decent looking on the page. I stayed away from doing any major CSS yet since I want 
    to focus on that in the upcoming week, but there's some inline styles provided to make the page a little prettier-->
<body>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0">
        <h1>Assignment #1: HTML Page</h1>
        <h2>Elijah Shaw</h2>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left">
        <h3>Sample Text</h3>
            <p>This is a sample <strong>paragraph</strong>. A <strong>paragraph</strong> is made up of sentences. The HTML tag doesn't have that requirement. <em>This</em> sentence in particular contains a <span style="color:royalblue">styled span of text.</span></p>
        <h3>Sample Structures</h3>
            <table style="width: 300px; border: 1px solid black">

                        <td width="50%">This information is incredibly useful.</td>
