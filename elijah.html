<!-- I'm going to leave this comment here and not spread out in the code because this is really simple HTML, but I basically just added every required 
    tag from the assignment and tried to make them at least somewhat decent looking on the page. I stayed away from doing any major CSS yet since I want 
    to focus on that in the upcoming week, but there's some inline styles provided to make the page a little prettier-->
<body>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0">
        <h1>Assignment #1: HTML Page</h1>
        <h2>Elijah Shaw</h2>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left">
        <h3>Sample Text</h3>
            <p>This is a sample <strong>paragraph</strong>. A <strong>paragraph</strong> is made up of sentences. The HTML tag doesn't have that requirement. <em>This</em> sentence in particular contains a <span style="color:royalblue">styled span of text.</span></p>
        <h3>Sample Structures</h3>
            <table style="width: 300px; border: 1px solid black">
                <caption>Table of Info</caption>
                <tablebody><!--Mark's comment 7/9: I think you mean tbody... I'm not sure tablebody is a tag.-->
                    <tr>
                        <th width="50%">Presumably Useful Info</th>
                        <th width="50%">Additional Useful Info</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td width="50%">This information is incredibly useful.</td>
                        <td width="50%">This information is also useful.</td>
                    </tr>

            </table>
            <ul>
                <caption>Kanto Region Starter Pokemon</caption><!--Mark's comment 7/9: I had to look up whether the caption tag could be used outside of a table and the answer is no. I mean, it works, but it's semantically incorrect. This StackOverflow page suggests using the figure and figcaption tags instead. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1141639/how-to-semantically-provide-a-caption-title-or-label-for-a-list-in-html/35019847#35019847 -->

        <h3>Sample Link</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">The Real Home Page of the Internet</a>
        <h3>Sample Image</h3>
            <img src="/images/luna.JPG" alt="A sunny photograph of my dog Luna" title="Luna" width="640" height="360"><!--Mark's comment 7/9: This works, but if you ever move this folder of .html files and the images subdirectory into another folder, this link will break since you have a / at the beginning which tells the web to go to the root folder and look for images/luna.JPG there... So, you should delete the first / and it'll say go to this current folder and look for images/luna.JPG-->
